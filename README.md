# Robot-Java
Implement a class Robot that simulates a robot wandering on an infinite plane. 
The robot is located at a point with integer coordinates and faces north, east, south, or west. Supply 
methods:
public void turnLeft()
public void turnRight()
public void move()
public Point getLocation()
public String getDirection()
The turnLeft and turnRight methods change the direction but not the location. The move method 
moves the robot by one unit in the direction it is facing. The getDirection method returns a string 
"N", "E", "S", or "W".
